# ShortestPath
This project is an implementation of [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) using TDD.

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, I've decided to implement it using TDD an as exercise purpose. I hope this can get you excited with TDD as it did to me.
